EMMAA Individual Paper Page
===========================

By clicking on a paper title on the Papers tab on model page, a user is redirected to
an individual paper page that contains model statements from this paper. The
view here is similar to the statement evidence or the all statements page with the 
exception that the statements and evidences are filtered to only those that
are extracted from a given paper. To browse and curate the evidences, a user
needs to click on a statement. Each statement can have multiple badges that
have the same meaning as in the statement evidence page. A blue badge with a flag
shows have many paths this statement is a part of. A green or a red badge with a 
pencil shows how many times this statement was curated as correct or incorrect 
respectively. An orange badge shows the statement's belief score.
The grey badge shows the number of loaded evidences and the total 
number of evidences supporting this statement. Clicking on the JSON badge opens a 
new page containing the JSON representation of the statement.
