EMMAA Dashboard
===============
The EMMAA Dashboard is accessible at
`http://emmaa.indra.bio <http://emmaa.indra.bio>`_.

The EMMAA Dashboard is the main entrypoint for users to interact
with models. Each card on a dashboard represents a model. Currently, users can
browse and link out to interactive, searchable network views of multiple
disease and pathways models, as well as details of
the latest tests applied to the models. The user can also navigate to a
queries page where queries about the models can be answered. Users are able
to sign up for specific notifications about one or more automatically
built, tested and analyzed models. Some models also have a Twitter account and
a link to it is provided on the dashboard if available.
