Configuring an EMMAA model
==========================

Each EmmaaModel has to be initiated with a config.json file. Config files can
be generated manually or automatically with relevant methods in :ref:`priors`
module (e.g. see :ref:`literature_prior` to start a model with default config
from literature).
This document describes the structure of the config.


First level fields of config.json
---------------------------------

- `name` : str
    A short name of a model.

    - Example: aml

- `search_terms` : list
    A list of jsonified SearchTerms (see `emmaa.priors`) to search the
    literature for.

    - Example:

    .. code-block:: json

        [{"type": "gene",
          "name": "PRKCA",
          "db_refs": {"HGNC": "9393", "UP": "P17252"},
          "search_term": "'PRKCA'"},
         {"type": "drug",
          "name": "SB 239063",
          "db_refs": {"HMS-LINCS": "10036",
                      "PUBCHEM": "5166",
                      "LINCS": "LSM-44951",
                      "CHEBI": "CHEBI:91347"},
          "search_term": "'SB 239063'"}]

- `human_readable_name` : str
    A human readable name of the model that will be displayed on the dashboard.

    - Example: Acute Myeloid Leukemia

- `ndex` : dict, optional
    Configuration for NDEx network formatted as `{"network": <NDEx network ID>}`

    - Example:

    .. code-block:: json

        {"network": "ef58f76d-f6a2-11e8-aaa6-0ac135e8bacf"}

- `description`: str
    Description of a model (will be displayed on EMMAA dashboard).

    - Example: A model of molecular mechanisms governing AML, focusing on
      frequently mutated genes, and the pathways in which they are involved.

- `dev_only` : bool, optional
    Set to True if this model is still in development mode and should not be
    displayed on the main emmaa.indra.bio dashboard. Default: False.

- `twitter` : str, optional
    If the model has Twitter account, this field should provide a key to
    retrieve Twitter secret keys stored on AWS SSM.

    - Example: covid19

- `twitter_link` : str, optional
    URL to model's Twitter account if it exists.

    - Example: https://twitter.com/covid19_emmaa

- `run_daily_update` : bool
    Whether the model should be updated with new literature daily.

- `run_daily_tests` : bool
    Whether the model should be assembled and tested daily. Note that by
    default all models that are updated are also assembled and tested, so this
    argument is only necessary for the models that are not updated daily (e.g.
    rasmodel is a manual model that isn't updated daily but we want to test
    it since the tests created from literature-based models can
    change).

- `export_formats` : list[str], optional
    A list of formats the model can be exported to. Accepted values include:
    `indranet`, `pybel`, `sbml`, `kappa`, `kappa_im`, `kappa_cm`, `gromet`,
    `bngl`, `sbgn`, `pysb_flat`, `kappa_ui`. Note that `kappa_ui` option does
    not generate a separate export file but adds a link to Kappa interactive
    UI that uses model's kappa export (generated if `kappa` is in this list).

- `assembly` : dict or list[dict]
    Configuration of model assembly represented as a dictionary where each
    key is a type of assembly (`main` for general purpose assembly steps and
    `dynamic` for additional steps to assemble a simulatable model) and
    values should contain corresponding jsonified steps to pass into the INDRA
    AssemblyPipeline class. Each step should have a `function` key and, if
    appropriate, `args` and `kwargs` keys.
    For more information on AssemblyPipeline, see
    https://indra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/pipeline.html
    For backward compatibility, if a model has only one type of assembly
    (`main`), assembly configuration can be a list of steps instead of a
    dictionary with assembly types.

    - Example:

    .. code-block:: json

        {"main": [
            {"function": "map_grounding",
             "kwargs": {"grounding_map": {

                "viral replication cycle": {"MESH": "D014779"}}}},
            {"function": "run_preassembly",
             "kwargs": {"return_toplevel": false,
                        "belief_scorer": {

                            "kwargs": {"bucket": "indra-belief",
                                       "key": "1.20.0/default_scorer.pkl"}
                            }
                        }},
            {"function": "filter_by_curation",
             "args": [{"function": "get_curations"},
                      "any",
                      ["correct", "act_vs_amt", "hypothesis"]],
             "kwargs": {"update_belief": true}}
            ],
         "dynamic": [
            {"function": "filter_by_type",
             "args": [{"stmt_type": "Complex"}],
             "kwargs": {"invert": true}},
            {"function": "filter_direct"},
            {"function": "filter_belief", "args": [0.95]}
            ]
        }

    Configuration of model queries. For more details see
    :ref:`query_config`

- `make_tests` : bool or dict, optional
    It is possible to create tests from model assembled statements to test
    other models against them. If set to True, then tests will be created
    from all assembled statements. For details on filtering the statements
    to a specific subset, see :ref:`make_tests_config`

    page on the EMMAA dashboard.

    - Example : "large_corpus_tests"

- `mc_types` : list[str]
    A list of network types a model should be assembled into. For each of the
    model types, a ModelChecker instance will be created and used to find
    explanations to tests. Accepted elements are: `pysb`, `pybel`, 
    `signed_graph`, `unsigned_graph`, `dynamic`.

- `statement_checking` : dict, optional
    Maximum paths and maximum path length to limit test results. In the most
    general case the dictionary should have only two keys (`max_path_length`
    and `max_paths`) but it is also possible to set a custom configuration for
    one model type. In this case, a nested dictionary can be added with
    model type as a key and a simple dictionary with the same two keys as a
    value. Default: {"max_path_length": 5, "max_paths": 1}.

    - Example (adding a custom config to a model type):

    .. code-block:: json

        {"statement_checking": {
            "max_paths": 1,
            "max_path_length": 4,
            "pybel": {
                "max_paths": 1,

                }
            }
        }

- `filters` : dict
    Configuration for applying semantic filters to the model checking process.
    It is represented as a dictionary mapping a test corpus name to a filter
    function name. The filter function should be defined in
    :ref:`filter_functions` and registered with `@register_filter('node')`
    decorator.

    - Example:

    .. code-block:: json

        {"filters": {
            "covid19_mitre_tests" : "filter_chem_mesh_go"
            }
        }

- `edge_filters` : dict
    Configuration to apply edge filters to the model checking process.
    It is represented as a dictionary mapping a test corpus name to an edge
    filter function name. Filter function should be defined in
    :ref:`filter_functions` and registered with `@register_filter('edge')`
    decorator.

    - Example:

    .. code-block:: json

        {"edge_filters": {
            "covid19_tests" : "filter_to_internal_edges"
            }
        }

- `direct_paths` : dict
    Configuration whether to allow direct paths as a test result. Should be
    set per test corpus. If not provided, set to True for all test corpora
    (i.e. allow direct paths).


    - Example:

    .. code-block:: json

        {"direct_paths": {
            "covid19_tests" : false
            }
        }

- `indranet_method` : str, optional
    Which method to use in IndraNetAssembler if signed_graph and unsigned_graph
    are in `mc_types`. Assepted values: `df` and `preassembly`. Default:
    `preassembly`.

.. _query_config:

Model queries configuration
---------------------------
Configuration for model queries represented as a dictionary keyed by the type
of query: `statement_checking` (source-target paths), `open_search`
(up/down-stream paths), `dynamic` (temporal properties), and `intervention`
(source-target dynamics). Configuration for `statement_checking` and
`open_search` queries is similar to the model test `statement_checking` format.
Same as in test config, it is possible to set different values for different
model types.

Configuration for `dynamic` and `intervention` queries has different fields 
(all optional):

- `use_kappa` : bool
    Determines the mode of the simulation. If True, uses `kappa`, otherwise,
    runs the ODE simulations. Default: False.

- `time_limit` : int
    Number of seconds to run the simulation for. Default: 200000.

- `num_times` : int
    Number of time points in the simulation plot. Default: 100.

- `num_sim` : int
    Number of simulations to run. This should be only provided if
    `hypothesis_tester` is not set. Default: 2.

- `hypothesis_tester` : dict; currently only for `dynamic`, not `intervention`.
    Configuration to test a hypothesis using random samples with adaptive size.
    If this is given, `num_sim` should not be provided. The `hypothesis_tester`
    dictionary should include the following keys: `alpha` (Type-I error limit,
    between 0 and 1), `beta` (Type-II error limit, between 0 and 1), `delta`
    (indifference parameter for interval around `prob` in both directions),
    `prob` (probability threshold for the hypothesis, between 0 and 1).

Having `dynamic` and `intervention` key in query config is required for a
model to be listed as an option for model selection on temporal properties
and source-target dynamics queries pages (for path-based queries all models
will be listed).

    - Example (all query types):

    .. code-block:: json

        {"statement_checking": {
            "max_paths": 5,
            "max_path_length": 4,
            "pybel": {
                "max_paths": 10,
                "max_path_length": 10
                }
            },
         "open_search": {
            "max_paths": 50,
            "max_path_length": 2
            },
         "dynamic": {
            "use_kappa": true,
            "time_limit": 100,
            "num_times": 100,
            "hypothesis_tester": {"alpha": 0.1,
                                  "beta": 0.1,
                                  "delta": 0.05,
                                  "prob": 0.8}
            },
         "intervention": {
            "use_kappa": true,
            "time_limit": 1000,
            "num_times": 100,
            "num_sim": 1
            },
        }

.. _make_tests_config:

Making tests from model configuration
-------------------------------------
Configuration to filter the statements before creating the tests (e.g. to make
tests from literature derived statements and skip curated). It is the value
mapped to the key `make_tests` in the model config (if you do not need to filter
the statements and want to make tests from all assembled statements, it is
enough to set `make_tests` to True).
To filter statements, the `make_tests` should be set to dictionary with the
key `filter` and the value should be another dictionary with the following fields:

- `conditions` : dict
    Conditions represented as key-value pairs that statements'
    metadata can be compared to.

- `evid_policy`: str
    Policy for checking statement's evidence objects. If "all", then the
    function returns True only if all of statement's evidence objects meet
    the conditions. If "any", the function returns True as long as at
    least one of statement's evidences meets the conditions.


    .. code-block:: json

        {"make_tests":
            {"filter": {
                "conditions": {"curated": false},
                "evid_policy": "any"
                }
            }
        }
